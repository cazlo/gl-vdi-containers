* Using VirtualGL with VMware Workstation

VirtualGL can also be used with VMware Workstation, and the concept is
basically the same as that of VirtualBox.  As with VirtualBox, VMware uses a
special driver in the guest O/S to intercept the OpenGL commands and marshal
them to the host O/S, where VirtualGL picks them up.

To use VirtualGL with VMware Workstation, perform the following procedures:

	#. Launch VMware Workstation and use the VMware Workstation GUI to create and
		test your virtual machine.

	#. Follow the procedures outlined in the VMware Workstation User's Manual to
		enable 3D acceleration in the virtual machine.  If possible, verify that 3D
		acceleration works on a local display __without__ VirtualGL before adding
		VirtualGL to the mix.

	#. Follow the procedure described in {ref prefix="Chapter ": setuid_linux} to
		make {file: libvglfaker.so} and {file: libdlfaker.so} setuid executables.

	#. Exit VMware Workstation and re-launch it with ''vglrun''.

*** NOTES
#OPT: noList! plain!

	* You might want to temporarily enable profiling (add an argument of ''+pr''
		to ''vglrun'' above) or set the ''VGL_LOGO'' environment variable to ''1''
		in order to verify that VirtualGL is loaded and working.
