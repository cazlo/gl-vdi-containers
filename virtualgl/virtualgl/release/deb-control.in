Description: A toolkit for displaying OpenGL applications to thin clients
 VirtualGL is a toolkit that allows most Linux/Unix OpenGL applications to be
 remotely displayed with 3D hardware acceleration to thin clients, regardless
 of whether the clients have 3D rendering capabilities, and regardless of the
 size of the 3D data being rendered or the speed of the network.
 .
 Using the vglrun script, the VirtualGL Faker library is preloaded into an
 OpenGL application at run time.  The faker then intercepts and modifies
 ("interposes") certain GLX, OpenGL, X11, and XCB function calls in order to
 seamlessly redirect 3D rendering from the application's windows into
 corresponding GPU-attached off-screen buffers, read back the rendered frames,
 and transport the frames to the "2D X Server" (the X server to which the
 application's GUI is being displayed), where the frames are composited back
 into the application's windows.
 .
 VirtualGL can be used to give hardware-accelerated 3D rendering capabilities
 to VNC and other X proxies that either lack OpenGL support or provide it
 through a software renderer.  In a LAN environment, VGL can also be used with
 its built-in high-performance image transport (the VGL Transport), which sends
 the rendered frames to the VirtualGL Client application for compositing on a
 client-side 2D X server.  VirtualGL also supports image transport plugins,
 allowing the rendered frames to be sent or captured using other mechanisms.
 .
 VirtualGL is based upon ideas presented in various academic papers on this
 topic, including "A Generic Solution for Hardware-Accelerated Remote
 Visualization" (Stegmaier, Magallon, Ertl 2002) and "A Framework for
 Interactive Hardware Accelerated Remote 3D-Visualization" (Engel, Sommer,
 Ertl 2000.)
