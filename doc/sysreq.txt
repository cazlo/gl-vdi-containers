		but currently-supported versions of \
		[[http://www.redhat.com/products/enterprise-linux/][Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] \
		and its derivatives, [[http://www.ubuntu.com][Ubuntu]] LTS, and \
		[[http://www.suse.com][SuSE]] Linux Enterprise tend to receive the most \
		attention from the VirtualGL community. \

	!!! The client requirements do not apply to anaglyphic stereo.  See
